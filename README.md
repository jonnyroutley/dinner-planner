# House Dinner Planner
A website to show who is in for dinner over the next two weeks.

## To-Do:
- [x] Setup Auth
- [x] Setup Database
- [x] Populate db?
- [x] Create Edit page
- [ ] Make names fit in circles (on mobile as well). This will probably involve creating a feature for users to set their own username or using initials with a hover to show full name feature
- [ ] Add ability for users to change the time of a particular dinner 

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
